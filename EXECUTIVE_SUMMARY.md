# RBAC System - Executive Summary

## Project Overview
**Project Title:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System  
**Technology Stack:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, JWT Authentication  
**Project Type:** Web Application with RESTful API  
**Duration:** Development Period  
**Team:** Individual Project  

## Problem Statement
Modern web applications require robust user management systems that can handle authentication securely, manage different user roles and permissions, provide granular access control, and scale with application growth.

## Solution
Developed a comprehensive RBAC system using modern web technologies that provides:
- **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with password hashing
- **Flexible Authorization:** Role and permission-based access control
- **RESTful API:** Well-designed API with comprehensive documentation
- **Web Interface:** User-friendly administration dashboard
- **Scalable Architecture:** Modular design for easy maintenance and expansion

## Key Features
1. **User Management:** Registration, login, logout, and user administration
2. **Role Management:** Create, assign, and manage user roles
3. **Permission System:** Granular permission control for resources
4. **API Protection:** Middleware for automatic permission checking
5. **Admin Dashboard:** Web-based interface for system administration
6. **Security:** Industry-standard security practices implemented

## Technical Architecture
- **Backend:** FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database:** SQLite with relational design
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript with REST API integration
- **Documentation:** Auto-generated API documentation
